# üöå Bus Ticket Booking Website üéüÔ∏è

The Bus Ticket Booking Website is a simple web application that allows users to book bus tickets online. The website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, and it includes a MySQL database to store user information and bookings.

## üìÅ Files in the Repository

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file for the website.
- `style.css`: The CSS stylesheet for the website.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for the website.
- `booking.php`: The PHP file for handling booking requests.
- `config.php`: The PHP file for configuring the database connection.
- `admin.php`: The PHP file for the admin panel.
- `db.sql`: The SQL file for creating the database schema.

In addition to the code files, the repository also includes two documentation files: `Project_Documentation.docx` and `Project_Explanation.docx`.

The `Project_Documentation.docx` file provides a detailed overview of the project, including its purpose, features, and technical specifications. It also includes screenshots of the website and its various pages, as well as a description of the database schema.

The `Project_Explanation.docx` file provides a step-by-step explanation of how the website works, including the various HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP files involved in the project. It includes code snippets and screenshots to illustrate the functionality of the website.

These documentation files provide a comprehensive overview of the project and are a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about how the website works or how to modify it.

## üöÄ Usage

To use the website, you will need to set up a web server with PHP and MySQL installed. Once you have set up the web server, you can clone the repository onto your server and configure the database connection in the `config.php` file.

Once the database is configured, you can open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the website. Users can select a bus route, enter their details, and book a ticket. The data is stored in the MySQL database.

The website also includes a simple admin panel, accessible through `admin.php`, which allows administrators to view and manage bookings.
